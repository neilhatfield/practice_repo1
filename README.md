# Neil's Practice Repo

This is a practice repo to demonstrate creating repos on GitHub for Stat184, Fall 2025. While there is no formal project for this repo, I will be using this repo to show students how to set up and work with GitHub repositories in the Stat 184 class.

There are no data files associated with this repository.

## Current Plan

Within this repo, we will be practicing the following:

1. Making repos
2. Making commits with good subjects/messages
3. Using branches
4. Setting up an initial README
5. Using the Issues feature

## Repo Organization
This repo will use a simple organizational structure. All files will be found in the top level and without any sub-folders.
